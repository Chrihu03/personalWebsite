            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> 
                Not much to say about myself.  I spent most of my childhood in a small New Hampshire town.  During that time, my family made a few small moves due to my father’s work in industrial construction, but we would return to the same house in New Hampshire.   In the winter of my first year of high school, my parents decided they had enough of the New England winters and decided to move to the southeast, which also happened to be closer to where my father had been doing most of his work in recent years.

                In high school I was not the best student.  I was smart but I was lazy as well.  I would often only do enough of my homework to learn the subject matter and then spend the rest of the time playing video games or playing Dungeons & Dragons or BattleTech with friends.  Unfortunately, this mentality led to me having average grades in high school as I would score well on tests but would have low assignment scores.

                In my high school academic career, I walked a strange path.  As my family were farmers and construction workers, I ended up taking various shop and building trade classes.  But that type of work never really interested me.  And to this day, I am still not sure why I took them. I think I was trying to make a connection with my father and brothers. The other side of my HS academic career was filled with advanced classes. Advanced sciences, math, Latin and even computer programming.  I found these studies far more interesting but outside of class, I was alone as my family had no knowledge of or interest in them.

                After graduating from high school, my father had me start working construction with him.  I am not sure what his goal was.  At the time, I was under the impression it was to see how hard this work was and to try to motivate me to focus harder when I did decided to go to college. I am not sure if they ever really thought that I would.  I mean, no one else in my immediate family went to college.  Most of my brothers barely managed to complete high school.

                After about a year of working construction I had saved up enough to go to a local junior college.  Since I was interested in computers and had a blast doing Pascal programming in High School, I decided to go into the Information Technology program.  In this program I continued my studies in Computer Programming in languages like C++, COBOL, Visual Basic.  I also got introduced to databases and SQL along with algorithms and more math.  However, this school had the belief that the only software their students would go to work on would be accounting software and thus half of the curriculum was around accounting and economics.

                I was about three quarters of the way through the program, and I heard about a school in the Seattle area that specialized in video game development. This excited me as I was a video game geek, so I applied and got accepted.

                Turned out that going to Digipen wasn’t the best choice for me for several reasons.  It was a very small school that at the time only offered two programs and the entire student body was only a couple hundred students, so it didn’t have any dorms.  Not having dorms meant that I needed to get an apartment and have a job to pay for it.  Also, the school was still going through the accreditation process and had a very dense curriculum.  Those factors mixed with depression and anxiety caused me to struggle with the course work and eventually drop out.

                After leaving Digipen, I did manual software QA testing for about the next decade, mainly at Nintendo but also at Microsoft and some other smaller studios.  Personal issues forced me to return home and eventually led to me getting a contract at Amazon to do some QA testing on a new internal SaaS tool which in turn led to me being a team-member on the team that ended up using the tool I ended up testing.

                Management of the team needed a way to track associate performance and my manager knew that I had some programming exposure and had me create some Excel macros to help generate associate score cards.  Management was impressed with my Excel macros as it reduced the PQA Leads effort to create score cards from being an all-day task to being about an hour once a week. 
                his led to my manager to look into SDE mentoring opportunities for me and also encouraged me to go back to school and get my degree.  After a few months of SDE mentoring, I was offered an apprentice SDE position, which started with a 16-week bootcamp style learning followed by a year plus of working on a team working on small to medium sized problems. At the end of my SDE apprenticeship, I was offered an SDE I position on the team that I had been apprenticing on.
